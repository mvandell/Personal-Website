            <h3 style="margin-top: 10px;">Biography:</h3>
            <p>I didn't start out wanting to code - the idea of being stuck in a cubicle all day did not appeal to me
                one bit. So, I studied agriculture at UC Davis and worked at their Student Farm for a time.</p>
            <p>At a local community college in the San Francisco Bay Area, I took a couple coding classes for fun and
                because my dad thought I would be good at it since I like solving puzzles. Honestly, it was interesting
                and satisfying coding and solving coding problems.</p>
            <p>During the pandemic, I realized there weren't many opportunities for a Plant Science degree without a
                car. I reflected on what I wanted to do and realized what I wanted out of a job wasn't necessarily
                working out in the fields (though that's still nice and satisfying), but camraderie with a team of good
                people.</p>
            <p>Since coding had given me a little spark, I chose to pursue it. But because I didn't want to spend
                another 4 or more years at a university, and I wanted a job, I searched for a bootcamp. I soon found
                Fullstack Academy's Grace Hopper Web Development Part-time Bootcamp. It ended up being the perfect way
                to learn coding, surrounded by supportive, aspiring women who also wanted to learn web development, and
                the best teacher who taught in a way that worked for me.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
            <p>Camping, Anime, Gaming</p>

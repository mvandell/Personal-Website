            While its name gives away the basis of the website, the real reason we chose to make it was to help everyday
            people find everyday cookware, especially those just starting out on their cooking journeys. With all of the
            kitchen equipment out there, it can be hard to know what works the best.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookware Critique allows users to browse kitchen equipment and read/write reviews for them.

            This website is an easy-to-use, yet robust, way for my mom to share important information about her business. The simple layout allows users to quickly find what they are looking for, without extra elements distracting them. It is designed to both draw in new students and provide up-to-date information to her current students.

# Personal Website

My first project for the Fullstack Academy Grace Hopper part-time bootcamp.

This project is mostly HTML files, with a little CSS. All of the editing was done in the VS Code IDE.

To use this project, clone the repo down to your local computer or download the code directly, then open a server to view the website.
